ductile /brittle transition temperature (glass transition temp) E1356

First there is sample preparation on molding machine. then these sampes will ne placed in the UTM(universal tensile machine). After appling the load n sample there would be elonagtion. After that there is crack in the sample. Lastly the readings would be noted on computer . there is a stress strain curve for the sampe. Ductlie and brittle temp rature can be identified.
